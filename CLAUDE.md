# Terraform — conventions for AI agents

This file tells an AI coding agent how to write, change and verify Terraform code in this repository. It is organised in three layers so it can be reused elsewhere:

- **Part 0** — how the agent works (what it may do, what it must never do). Always keep.
- **Part 1** — Terraform rules, provider-agnostic. Always keep.
- **Part 2** — AWS rules. Delete it if this repo does not target AWS; copy its structure to add another provider (a skeleton for that is at the end).
- **Part 3** — repository-specific values. Fill it in: an agent follows a written convention and invents a missing one.

Rules use MUST / NEVER / PREFER. MUST and NEVER are not negotiable. PREFER is the default, and deviating from it requires a one-line justification in the code or the PR.

---

## Part 0 — How the agent works here

### The deliverable is the plan, not the code

Terraform code that "looks right" is not the goal. A `terraform plan` that does exactly what was asked, and nothing else, is. Every change you make ends with you reading the plan and reporting what it will create, update, replace or destroy. If you cannot run a plan (no credentials, no backend access), say so explicitly rather than asserting the code is correct.

### Commands you propose, a human runs

- NEVER run `terraform apply`, `terraform destroy`, `terraform state rm|mv|push`, `terraform import`, `terraform workspace delete`, or `terraform force-unlock`. Produce the command and the reasoning; a human executes it after reading the plan.
- You MAY run `terraform fmt`, `terraform init` (with `-backend=false` when no backend access is intended), `terraform validate`, `terraform plan`, `terraform test`, `terraform show`, `terraform providers`, `tflint`, `trivy config`, `terraform-docs`.
- A plan containing `destroy` or `replace` (`-/+`) MUST be flagged in your summary, line by line, before anything else. Do not bury it.

### Verification loop, every time

After every edit, before reporting done, run in order and fix what fails:

1. `terraform fmt -recursive`
2. `terraform validate`
3. `tflint` (with the provider ruleset enabled)
4. `trivy config .` (or the scanner configured in this repo)
5. `terraform test` if tests exist
6. `terraform plan` if you have access

A green scanner after your changes is a weaker signal than a green scanner on hand-written code. When you fix a security finding, state what the effective permissions or exposure are before and after. Restructuring a policy until the scanner is quiet is not a fix.

### Things you must never do to "make it pass"

- NEVER delete or comment out a resource, a `validation`, a `precondition`, a `check`, or a test to make a plan or a test succeed. Report the conflict instead.
- NEVER widen an IAM permission, a firewall rule or a network range to unblock yourself.
- NEVER add `lifecycle { ignore_changes = all }` or a broad `ignore_changes` as a workaround.
- NEVER invent a resource type, argument or attribute. If you are unsure whether it exists in the pinned provider version, look it up (see MCP below); if you cannot, say so.
- NEVER change a pinned version (Terraform, provider, module) as a side effect of another task. Version bumps are their own change, with the changelog read and summarised.

### Context and freshness

- Terraform and provider syntax changes faster than training data. For any provider resource you touch, check the documentation for the version pinned in this repo via the Terraform MCP server (`terraform-mcp-server`) before writing code. At the start of a session, confirm the MCP server responds; if it does not, say so and treat generated provider arguments as unverified.
- Read `.terraform.lock.hcl`, `versions.tf` and this file before proposing anything.
- The agent sees the code, not the state or the target account. Anything that depends on state (`import`, `moved`, `removed`, drift, what a `destroy` will actually remove) needs a human with access. Say what you cannot see.

### Secrets and sensitive data

- NEVER read, print, or paste into your own context: `*.tfstate`, `*.tfstate.backup`, `*.tfvars` containing credentials, `.env`, private keys, tokens. If a task requires them, ask the human to extract the non-sensitive part.
- NEVER hard-code a secret, even a placeholder that looks real. Use variables marked `sensitive`, ephemeral resources or write-only arguments (Part 1).

### Scope discipline

- Do what was asked. Do not refactor, rename, "clean up" or reformat unrelated code in the same change. Suggest it separately.
- When a request is ambiguous about something irreversible (a resource replacement, a state move, a CIDR change), ask before writing code.

---

## Part 1 — Terraform, provider-agnostic

### Versions and pinning

- `versions.tf` at the root of every root module and every module MUST declare `required_version` and `required_providers` with `source` and `version`.
- Terraform binary: PREFER `required_version = ">= X.Y, < 2.0"` with X.Y being the minimum the code needs (see Part 3). Do not use `~> 1.0`: it means "any 1.x" and hides real needs.
- Providers: pessimistic constraint on the major, e.g. `version = "~> 6.0"`. Same value across every module of the repo.
- Modules from a registry: exact version (`version = "3.18.1"`, no `v` prefix), preferably the latest release compatible with the pinned provider. Modules from git: pin a tag or a commit SHA in `?ref=`, never a branch.
- `.terraform.lock.hcl` MUST be committed. Regenerate it with `terraform providers lock -platform=linux_amd64 -platform=darwin_arm64 ...` for every platform used (developer machines and CI).
- OpenTofu: if the repo uses OpenTofu, say so in Part 3. Most rules here apply; state encryption and early variable evaluation are OpenTofu-only, `ephemeral` and write-only arguments have diverging support. Do not mix `terraform` and `tofu` commands in one repo.

### Repository layout
TODO: this needs to be updated with the repository where the terraform code lives by the user of this CLAUDE.md

### Files and formatting

- `terraform fmt` is mandatory; the CI fails on `fmt -check`.
- Standard file names: `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `versions.tf`, `locals.tf`, `providers.tf` (root modules only), `data.tf` when data sources are numerous. Split `main.tf` by concern (`network.tf`, `iam.tf`) when it exceeds a few hundred lines.
- Resource names: `snake_case`, no repetition of the type (`resource "aws_s3_bucket" "logs"`, not `"logs_bucket"`). Use `this` for the single main resource of a module.
- `.gitignore` MUST exclude `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars` except explicitly committed non-sensitive ones (`*.auto.tfvars` reviewed), `crash.log`, `*.plan`.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*. Any deliberate deviation from these conventions (a wide permission in a sandbox, a `count` where `for_each` was expected) gets a comment starting with `# DELIBERATE:` and the reason.

### Modules

- A module does one thing and exposes a small, stable interface. Do not write a module that wraps a single resource without adding logic, validation or conventions.
- PREFER local modules by relative path (`source = "../../modules/vpc"`) inside the repo; registry or git sources with pinned versions for shared modules.
- Modules MUST NOT declare `provider` blocks. They declare `required_providers` and receive providers from the caller (`providers = { aws = aws.eu }` when aliases are needed).
- Every module ships with: `README.md` (generated by `terraform-docs`, with a usage example), `examples/<case>/` runnable as-is, `tests/` (see Testing), and a `CHANGELOG.md` if published.
- No `output` of a value that is trivially derivable by the caller; every output that a caller needs to chain modules (IDs, ARNs, names). Outputs that carry secrets are marked `sensitive = true`, and the README says so — they still land in the state.
- Before extracting existing resources into a module, generate `moved` blocks so the plan is empty. An empty plan is the acceptance criterion of a refactoring.

### Variables, locals, outputs

- Every variable has `type` (strict: `object({...})` over `map(any)`), `description`, and a `default` only if a sensible one exists. No `type = any`.
- Booleans that switch a feature are named `enable_<feature>` or `create_<thing>`.
- Use `validation` blocks for every constraint the provider will not enforce early: naming patterns, allowed values, CIDR shape, length limits. Error messages state the rule and the received value. Cross-variable validation (referencing other variables or resources) is available since Terraform 1.9.
- `nullable = false` on variables that must not be null. `sensitive = true` on secrets.
- Locals for repeated expressions, computed names and tag maps. Not for constants that should be variables, not as a dumping ground.
- Outputs have a `description`. Root-module outputs are the contract read by other states (`terraform_remote_state` or, preferably, a data source on the actual resource).

### Meta-arguments: `for_each`, `count`, `depends_on`, `lifecycle`

- PREFER `for_each` over `count` whenever there is more than one instance. `count` re-indexes and destroys resources when the list shifts; `for_each` keyed on a stable string does not.
- `count = var.create ? 1 : 0` is the accepted idiom for an optional single resource. That is the *only* use of `count`. (A "conditional resource" is a `count` of 0 or 1 — there is no separate mechanism.) Reference it as `resource.name[0]` and expose it through `one(resource.name[*].id)` in outputs.
- Never `for_each` on a set of values that are not known at plan time (computed IDs); key on names or input keys instead.
- `depends_on` is a last resort for hidden dependencies (IAM propagation, eventual consistency). Prefer implicit dependencies through attribute references. Comment every `depends_on`.
- `lifecycle`:
  - `prevent_destroy = true` on stateful resources (databases, buckets holding data, KMS keys, DNS zones).
  - `create_before_destroy = true` on resources whose replacement must not cause downtime (launch templates, certificates, security groups referenced elsewhere).
  - `ignore_changes` only on specific attributes that are legitimately managed elsewhere (autoscaling `desired_capacity`, image tags pushed by a deploy pipeline), each with a comment. Never `all`.
  - `precondition` / `postcondition` to encode assumptions about inputs and results (Terraform 1.2+), `check` blocks for assertions that must not block the apply (1.5+).

### State

- Remote backend MUST be used for anything beyond a throwaway experiment; the backend storage MUST be versioned, encrypted at rest, private, and support locking. Provider-specific configuration is in Part 2.
- One state per root module. Never share a state between environments.
- State manipulation (`state mv|rm|push`, `import`, `force-unlock`) is human-only, after a backup (`terraform state pull > backup.tfstate` — the human does this, not you).
- PREFER `moved`, `removed` and `import` *blocks* in code (Terraform 1.1 / 1.7 / 1.5) over the CLI equivalents: they are reviewable in a PR and replayable. `import` blocks are supported inside modules since Terraform 1.16. Use `terraform plan -generate-config-out=` to bootstrap configuration of imported resources, then clean the generated code.
- `terraform_remote_state` couples states tightly. PREFER a data source on the real resource, or a parameter/secret store as a contract between states.
- Drift: the state is not the truth, the platform is. When asked about "what exists", say that only a `plan` (or `terraform query` / `list` blocks, Terraform 1.14+) against the account can answer.

### Secrets

- Anything Terraform reads or writes ends up in the state in clear text, including values marked `sensitive` (that flag only masks CLI output). Design on that assumption.
- PREFER, in this order:
  1. Not having Terraform touch the secret at all (the application fetches it at runtime from a secret manager Terraform only *references*).
  2. Ephemeral resources (Terraform 1.10+) and write-only arguments (`*_wo`, Terraform 1.11+, provider support required): the value is sent to the provider and never persisted. For values that must survive plan-to-apply, `terraform_data` with a `store` block (Terraform 1.16+).
  3. `random_password` + `sensitive` + encrypted state, as a fallback, documented as such.
- Never a secret in a `default`, in a committed `.tfvars`, in an `output` without `sensitive`, or in a `local`.
- Rotation MUST be possible without a `destroy`: use `*_version` resources or keepers on `random_*` resources.

### Naming and tagging (generic)

- One naming convention for the whole repo, defined once in Part 3 and applied through a `local.name_prefix`. Typical shape: `<org>-<project>-<env>-<component>`, lowercase, hyphens. Respect per-service length and character limits (validate them).
- Globally or account-unique names (buckets, IAM roles, DNS) get a unique suffix (`random_id` or account/region) so several deployments can coexist. Never a hard-coded global name.
- Tags/labels are applied at provider level when the provider supports defaults, and merged with resource-specific tags otherwise. Minimum set, keys in Part 3: `environment`, `owner`, `project`, `cost_center`, `managed_by = "terraform"`, `root_module` (URL of the repository and path of the root module whose `apply` manages the resource). Add `data_classification` when the resource stores data.

### Testing and quality gates

- `terraform test` (Terraform 1.6+) is the default framework. `.tftest.hcl` files live in `tests/` next to the module. Use `command = plan` for logic and validation tests (fast, no credentials), `command = apply` for a small number of integration tests run in CI against a sandbox, with teardown guaranteed.
- Tests describe the *expected behaviour from the requirement*, not what the current code does. A test derived from reading the code is tautological. Before considering a test useful, break the code deliberately (remove the encryption block, change a default) and check that the test fails. If it does not, the test is worthless — rewrite it.
- Every `validation` block has at least one test with `expect_failures` for the rejected case and one passing case at the boundary. Every `precondition`/`postcondition` has a failing test.
- Every module has at least one runnable example under `examples/` and a test that plans it.
- Static analysis is mandatory in pre-commit and CI: `terraform fmt -check`, `validate`, `tflint` with the provider ruleset, `trivy config` (tfsec is discontinued and merged into Trivy; use `#trivy:ignore:<rule>` comments with a justification, never `#tfsec:ignore`), optionally `checkov`. Suppressions are commented, scoped to one resource, and reviewed.
- Cost estimation (`infracost` or equivalent) in the PR pipeline for anything that changes compute, storage or data transfer.

### CI/CD and workflow

- Pipeline stages: `fmt/validate/lint/scan` → `test` → `plan` (artifact saved, posted on the merge request) → manual approval → `apply` of *that saved plan file* (`terraform apply plan.out`), never a fresh plan at apply time.
- Production is applied only from the pipeline, from the default branch, with an identity that is short-lived (OIDC federation) and scoped to that root module. No long-lived cloud credentials in CI variables.
- Every root module gets a scheduled `plan` (drift detection) that alerts on a non-empty plan.
- `terraform init -upgrade` and lock file updates are separate, reviewed commits.
- Local developer identities are read-only by default; write access is elevated on purpose, for a session.

### Documentation

- `terraform-docs` generates the inputs/outputs/providers tables of every module README; the generated block is delimited and never hand-edited.
- The root `README.md` of the repository explains: how to authenticate, how to bootstrap the backend, deployment order between root modules, how to run tests, and how to tear down.
- Architecture decisions that constrain the code (why two VPCs, why this region) live in short ADRs, linked from the README.

### Cost and sustainability

Infrastructure as code decides the footprint for years; the cheapest and greenest resource is the one not created.

- Default to the smallest instance/tier that meets the stated requirement; scale-up is a variable, not a default. Do not "future-proof" sizes.
- Every non-production environment has a schedule (stop outside working hours) or a TTL, and `terraform destroy` works cleanly on it (no orphaned resources, no `prevent_destroy` outside prod, buckets emptied by `force_destroy = true` in non-prod only).
- PREFER managed, serverless or autoscaled services with scale-to-zero when the workload allows; PREFER ARM instances when the software supports them; PREFER regions with a low carbon intensity when latency and data residency allow (this is a Part 3 decision, not a per-resource one).
- Lifecycle rules on every storage bucket (transition, expiration, abort incomplete multipart uploads). Log retention is finite and explicit.
- When you propose a resource, mention its recurring cost order of magnitude if it is not negligible (NAT gateways, load balancers, managed databases, KMS keys, VPC endpoints).

## Part 2 — AWS

Delete this part if the repository does not target AWS. Keep Part 1 either way.

### Provider and authentication

- `required_providers { aws = { source = "hashicorp/aws", version = "~> 6.0" } }` (verify the current major before starting a new repo; align every module on the same constraint).
- Authentication through named profiles locally and OIDC role assumption in CI. NEVER `access_key` / `secret_key` arguments in a provider block, NEVER credentials in `.tfvars`.
- `default_tags` in the provider block carries the common tag set (Part 1); resource-level `tags` only add specific keys. Beware of resources that do not support `default_tags` (some `aws_autoscaling_group` tag semantics, resources tagged by other services).
- Multi-region: since provider v6, most resources accept a `region` argument; prefer it over multiplying provider aliases. Keep aliases for cases the argument does not cover (cross-region replication configuration, some global services).
- Multi-account: one root module per account/role; `assume_role` in the provider with a session name that identifies the pipeline or the human.

### Backend

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket       = "<org>-tfstate-<account-id>-<region>"
    key          = "<component>/<env>/terraform.tfstate"
    region       = "<region>"
    encrypt      = true
    kms_key_id   = "<kms key arn>"      # PREFER a customer-managed key over SSE-S3
    use_lockfile = true                 # native S3 locking, Terraform >= 1.10
  }
}
```

- `use_lockfile = true` replaces the DynamoDB lock table (`dynamodb_table` is deprecated). Do not create a DynamoDB table for locking in new code; remove it from existing code only as its own migration, after confirming every consumer of that state runs Terraform >= 1.10.
- The state bucket: versioning on, public access blocked, SSE-KMS, lifecycle rule to expire old versions after a defined period, bucket policy restricting access to the deploy roles, access logging to a separate bucket. It is bootstrapped once (by a dedicated tiny root module or manually, documented), never by the root module that uses it.

### IAM

- Least privilege by construction: explicit `actions`, explicit `resources` (ARNs or ARN patterns), `condition` blocks where the service supports them (`aws:SourceArn`, `aws:PrincipalOrgID`, `aws:RequestedRegion`). `"*"` on both actions and resources is forbidden outside a documented sandbox exception (`# DELIBERATE:`).
- Write policies with `data "aws_iam_policy_document"` rather than heredoc JSON: it validates structure and merges cleanly with `source_policy_documents`.
- Attach policies with `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment` or `aws_iam_role_policy`. The `managed_policy_arns` and `inline_policy` arguments on `aws_iam_role` are deprecated.
- Roles for humans and CI are assumed with short sessions (OIDC for GitLab/GitHub, IAM Identity Center for people). No IAM users with access keys except a documented break-glass.
- Names of IAM roles and policies are account-global: apply the unique prefix/suffix rule.
- Permission boundaries on roles created by pipelines, so a pipeline cannot create a role more powerful than itself.

### Encryption and data protection

- Encryption at rest is on for every service that supports it, with a customer-managed KMS key (`aws_kms_key` + `aws_kms_alias`) when the data is classified beyond public, and key rotation enabled (`enable_key_rotation = true`). SSE-S3 is acceptable for logs and non-sensitive artefacts only.
- S3: `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` with all four flags true on every bucket, `aws_s3_bucket_versioning` on buckets holding data, `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration` explicit, `aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration` present, bucket policy enforcing `aws:SecureTransport`. Bucket names are global: unique suffix mandatory.
- RDS/Aurora: `storage_encrypted = true`, `deletion_protection = true` in prod, `backup_retention_period` explicit, `publicly_accessible = false`, master password through `manage_master_user_password = true` (Secrets Manager) or a write-only argument, never a variable stored in state.
- Secrets: PREFER SSM Parameter Store `SecureString` for configuration and plain secrets (free tier, sufficient for most cases); Secrets Manager when rotation, cross-account sharing or RDS integration is needed. Write values with write-only arguments (`secret_string_wo`, `value_wo`) on a provider version that supports them.
- EBS default encryption enabled at account level (`aws_ebs_encryption_by_default`).
- CloudTrail, Config and GuardDuty are account-level baselines managed in a dedicated security root module, not per application.

### Networking

- VPC CIDRs from RFC 1918 ranges only, planned to avoid overlap across accounts and environments (document the plan in Part 3). No `/16` by default in small environments; size subnets for real needs.
- Subnet tiers: public (load balancers, NAT), private (compute), isolated (data stores, no route to NAT). Resources go in the most private tier that works.
- NAT gateways cost money per hour and per GB: one per AZ in prod for resilience, one per VPC in non-prod, none when VPC endpoints cover the needed services. Mention this trade-off when you create one.
- VPC endpoints (gateway endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB are free; interface endpoints are not) for AWS services reached from private subnets, before considering NAT.
- Security groups: `aws_vpc_security_group_ingress_rule` / `_egress_rule` resources rather than inline `ingress`/`egress` blocks (inline blocks and standalone rules conflict). No `0.0.0.0/0` ingress except on public load balancers on 80/443, and never on SSH/RDP. Egress restricted where practical. Reference security groups by ID, not CIDR, between tiers.
- `aws_instance`: `vpc_security_group_ids`, never `security_groups` (EC2-Classic legacy). `metadata_options { http_tokens = "required" }` (IMDSv2). Root volume encrypted. AMI from `data "aws_ssm_parameter"` on the public AMI parameters (`/aws/service/ami-amazon-linux-latest/...`) or `data "aws_ami"` with `owners` and a precise `filter` — provider v6 errors on `most_recent = true` without owner/filter. Never a hard-coded AMI ID.
- Transit Gateway when there are more than a handful of VPCs or accounts to interconnect; VPC peering below that. Both are architecture decisions to confirm with a human, not defaults.
- Flow logs enabled on production VPCs, to S3 or CloudWatch with a finite retention.

### Compute, scaling, availability

- Launch templates (never launch configurations) with `create_before_destroy`. Auto Scaling Groups with `instance_refresh` for rolling updates; `ignore_changes = [desired_capacity]` when a scaling policy owns it (commented).
- Multi-AZ for anything stateful in prod (`multi_az = true` on RDS, at least two subnets on ALBs and ASGs). Single-AZ is acceptable and cheaper in non-prod, as a variable.
- ECS/EKS: task or pod IAM roles (IRSA / Pod Identity), never node-level permissions for application access. Fargate or Graviton nodes by default when the images allow.
- Lambda: `reserved_concurrent_executions` considered, log group created explicitly with retention (otherwise Lambda creates one with infinite retention), ARM64 architecture by default.

### Observability

- Every log group is created in Terraform with `retention_in_days` set. No implicit, never-expiring log groups.
- CloudWatch alarms on the golden signals of what you create (errors, latency, saturation) and an AWS Budgets alert with a threshold per account/environment. Alarm actions go to an SNS topic managed in a shared module.

### Cost specifics

- Commitment discounts (Savings Plans, Reserved Instances/Capacity) are a FinOps decision taken outside Terraform on observed usage; do not encode "reserved in prod, on-demand in dev" in the code. What Terraform *does* control: instance families (Graviton), Spot for fault-tolerant workloads (`capacity_type = "SPOT"`, mixed instances policy), S3 storage classes and lifecycle, gp3 over gp2, scheduled scaling to zero in non-prod, NAT and endpoint strategy, log retention.
- Tag `cost_center` and `environment` are non-negotiable so cost allocation reports work.

### AWS-specific pitfalls to check in generated code

- Account IDs are strings, not numbers (they may start with 0). Validate with `^[0-9]{12}$`.
- ARNs: `arn:<partition>:<service>:<region>:<account-id>:<resource>`; partition is `aws`, `aws-cn` or `aws-us-gov` — use `data.aws_partition.current.partition` in shared modules.
- IAM is eventually consistent: a role used by a resource created in the same apply may need a `depends_on` on the policy attachment (comment it).
- Some resources are region-agnostic (IAM, Route 53, CloudFront in us-east-1 for certificates); do not pass a `region` argument to them.
- KMS keys have a 7–30-day deletion window; deleting and recreating a key breaks everything encrypted with it. `prevent_destroy` on keys.

### Organisation policy on AI usage (adapt or delete)

If your organisation has an AI usage policy, reference it here rather than restating it. Typical points that matter for Terraform work: which data classification the code falls under and therefore which tools are allowed on it; that secrets and state contents are never shared with any AI tool; that AI-assisted code delivered to a client is reviewed by a human and labelled as such; and that MCP servers, plugins and connectors go through a validation process before being enabled. At Ippon this is the *Charte IA* and its tool catalogue: check them before configuring an agent on client code.
